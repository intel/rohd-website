I'm excited to share that ROHD <https://github.com/intel/rohd> has been accepted to the 59th Design Automation Conference (DAC) this year in San Francisco as a poster in the Front-End Engineering Track! I'll be standing by the poster on Monday, July 11 at 5pm, so come check it out if you're attending!

Link to the program and abstract is [here](https://59dac.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=ETPOST124&sess=sess186).

The Rapid Open Hardware Development (ROHD) framework is an ambitious project I've been working on at Intel for designing and verifying hardware. It's entirely free and open source, includes a 4-value event-based simulator, and overall aims to replace SystemVerilog and revolutionize front-end hardware development. Give it a try! You won't be disappointed.
