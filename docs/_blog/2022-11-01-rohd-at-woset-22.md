I'm excited that ROHD has been accepted to WOSET this year!

You can see the abstract, paper, recorded presentation (both a ~20min and ~5 min version), and the slides in the proceedings:

ROHD is scheduled at 11:40AM this Thursday, November 3 (Pacific time). After a short presentation, I'll be answering questions. Hope to see you there!
