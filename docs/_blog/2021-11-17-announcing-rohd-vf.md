Your testbench is software, so write it as great software!

Announcing the ROHD Verification Framework, a hardware verification framework built upon ROHD (<https://github.com/intel/rohd>) for building testbenches.  It enables you to build testbenches in a similar structure as what UVM enables, but using a modern programming language (Dart) in a free & open source ecosystem and without the macro boilerplate of UVM.  ROHD-VF inherits all the great benefits of ROHD as well, so if you haven't seen that yet check it out!
