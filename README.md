# The ROHD Website

## [**Visit the ROHD Website, click here!**](https://intel.github.io/rohd-website/)

This repository hosts a website for the [Rapid Open Hardware Development (ROHD) framework](https://github.com/intel/rohd) and it's ecosystem.

The main ROHD ecosystem includes:
| Repository | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [rohd](https://github.com/intel/rohd) | The Rapid Open Hardware Development Framework (ROHD), the main repo |
| [rohd-vf](https://github.com/intel/rohd-vf) | The ROHD Verification Framework (ROHD-VF), like UVM but for ROHD |
| [rohd-cosim](https://github.com/intel/rohd-cosim) | ROHD Co-simulation (ROHD Cosim) for interacting with other simulators |
| [rohd-hcl](https://github.com/intel/rohd-hcl) | The ROHD Hardware Component Library (ROHD-HCL), reusable configurable components |

Generally, this website repository does *not* directly contain documentation covering the entire ecosystem.  Rather, it hosts general website infrastructure and references documentation content from the other repositories.  This repo can host some additional documentation that isn't directly related to the APIs of individual projects (e.g. meeting minutes).
